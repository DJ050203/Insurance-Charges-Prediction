Insurance Charges Prediction

This repository contains a Python project for predicting insurance charges using Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree models. The project is meant to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to predict insurance charges based on various features such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and more.

Introduction

In this project, we use machine learning techniques to build and compare two different regression models: Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree. These models are trained on a dataset of insurance charges and then used to predict charges for new data points.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the 'Insurance Charges' dataset, which can be found in the folder. The dataset contains information about individuals, including their age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and insurance charges.


## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following requirements installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploring the code and visualizations)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/DJ050203/Insurance-Charges-Prediction.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   bash
   cd Insurance Charges Prediction
   
3. Preprocess the data: Depending on your dataset format, you may need to preprocess it to extract relevant features.

4. Train the models: Use Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train the RandomForestRegressor and Decision Tree models using your preprocessed dataset.

5. Evaluate the models: Calculate performance metrics like R2 Score, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model to assess their performance.

## Usage

1. To make charges predictions, you can use the trained models to predict the charges based on input features.

2. You can also use the provided Jupyter Notebook to see examples of how to use the models for prediction.
